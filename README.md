A Naive-Bayes classifier program supporting:

1. Multinomial (Term Occurrences)
2. Bernoulli (Binary Term Occurences),

including k-fold cross validation (user input).

This python script was made for an assignment in a university course named "Information Retrieval and Search Engines".
The folder "txt_sentoken" contains 2000 movie reviews (1000 negative & 1000 positive). It was used for the aforementioned assignment. It is not necessary for the program's execution.

NOTE: During the first time usage, uncomment the lines 94-96. The NLTK library needs to have these dictionaries ('punkt' & 'stopwords') downloaded locally.
